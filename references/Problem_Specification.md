# Problem Specification

"I’ve attached a csv containing a daily timeseries  of historic weather observations (features) and gas demand actuals  (target) for gas years 2013 to 2018 inclusive for a fictional country.

Your objective is to use the Python toolset to  derive a forecasting model that returns out of sample predictions for  gas year 2018.

We’re interested in understanding how you approach  problems such as this and your level of Python knowledge. You are free  to analyse and present the results however you like."
